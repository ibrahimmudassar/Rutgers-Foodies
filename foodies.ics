This is open to any majors\, but we are able to specifically help with revising essays or studying for sociology exams\, since all of our E-Board is far into the Sociology major.

We'll have study materials available (pencils\, notecards\, etc.) We're also making mocktails- including shirley temples\, to enjoy during the study night. Come and hang out!
