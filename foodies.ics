CATEGORIES:ThoughtfulLearning,Busch,Educational Lecture
DESCRIPTION:  Synaptic dysfunction and dendritic spine abnormalities often underlie the cognitive symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Within the dendritic spine\, synaptic proteins such as receptors\, signaling molecules\, and scaffolding proteins are organized into sub-compartments called nanomodules. Previous studies have found that the number of nanomodules increases in proportion to synaptic strength and spine size\, with immature spines having fewer nanomodules compared to mature spines. Nevertheless\, the molecular players driving the formation of nanomodules in the synapse are not fully characterized. The scaffolding protein Partitioning Defective 3 (Par3) is known to promote subcellular compartmentalization. Furthermore\, recent work in our lab has found that loss of Par3 in mice results in an increased pool of immature dendritic spines. Therefore\, we hypothesize that Par3 may promote dendritic spine maturation and stability by driving the formation of nanomodules within the postsynaptic density. Unexpectedly\, I recently discovered that Par3 colocalizes and interacts with PSD95\, a key postsynaptic scaffolding protein. Moreover\, I have narrowed this interaction down to be between the C-terminal 4N2 domain of Par3 and the N-terminus of PSD95. Currently\, I am working to further characterize the Par3-PSD95 interaction by exploring whether this interaction relies on phase separation\, a common mechanism for subcellular compartmentalization of proteins. Additionally\, I am using super-resolution microscopy to examine the interaction between these two proteins in neurons and how synaptic activity affects the potential role of Par3 in regulating nanomodule formation at the synapse.
