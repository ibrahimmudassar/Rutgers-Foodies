DESCRIPTION:SSPAR is a seminar series where graduate students from the Physics and Astronomy Department present talks on any topic of their choice - research\, hobbies\, personal interests\, or just something fun. The talks are usually accompanied with dinner\, which the speaker gets to pick from local restaurants including Delhi Garden\, Efes\, Mamouns and more. The first SSPAR of the academic year will be held on October 2nd\, and Lana Eid will be our first presenter. We'll be ordering some delicious Lebanese food from Evelyn's! Hope to see you all there! Talk Title: Lessons from Cluster Lens Models: The Giant Arc in Abell 370. Abstract: We aim to improve cluster lens modeling and source reconstruction by utilizing the full information in giant\, caustic-crossing arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. Lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources\, but spatially extended giant arcs provide more constraints\; however\, they require a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the extended source. We use the Abell 370 cluster lens to examine how the constraints from lensed giant arcs compare with those from collections of point-like images. We find that existing Hubble Frontier Fields lens models cannot reproduce the Abell 370 arc in detail and result in unphysical source models. We then show that using the full arc as a constraint improves resolution-limited assumptions\, local parameters\, and critical curves in lens models. We also discuss a new python package currently being developed and designed for reconstructing lensed giant arcs\, which we use to evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression modes for de-lensed data. We finally discuss how this new method can be utilized for both high-resolution studies as well as large surveys.

She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric\, yarn\, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a Book Talk with Professor Andrés Mario Zervigón!   Wednesday\, October 15\, 2025\, 5.30 – 7.00 PM Art History Graduate Student Lounge\, Vorhees Hall\, 71 Hamilton Street\, New Brunswick   Print Matters: Media and Modernity in Illustrated Magazines\, 1910–1970Edited by Maria Antonella Pelizzari and Andrés Mario Zervigón Available November 2025 In the early to mid-twentieth century\, the vast majority of printed photographs appeared in the pages of illustrated magazines. Publications such as Life\, China Pictorial\, Drum\, Picture Post\, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today\, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications\, showing how their layouts were affected by political\, commercial\, editorial\, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images\, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents\, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andrés Mario Zervigón is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers\, the State University of New Jersey.
