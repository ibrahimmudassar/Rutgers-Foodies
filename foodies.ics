DESCRIPTION:Please join us for lunch from Merey as Becca talks us through her research and experience!  Genetic evidence supports that the polarity protein\, partitioning defective 1c (Par1c)\, also known as microtubule affinity regulating kinase 1 (MARK1)\, functions in higher level cognition. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MARK1 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and bipolar disorder. Furthermore\, MARK1 is highly expressed in forebrain pyramidal neurons and exhibits human-specific accelerated evolution\, suggesting its importance in the development of cognition. Par1c mediates synaptic plasticity in vitro through phosphorylation of PSD95. However\, whether Par1c is required for the induction or maintenance of synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here\, I will discuss my work developing a novel\, synaptic-targeted photoactivatable Par1c (paPar1c). Future studies will use paPar1c to determine if synaptic plasticity induction requires Par1c activation.
