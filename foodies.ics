CATEGORIES:Cultural,Film ,Graduate Student Organization Event
DESCRIPTION:About the film and discussion:  Anti-caste reformers from Jotiba Phule to Periyar and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression—a route to dignity\, mobility\, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical\, exclusionary\, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal\, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer’s life—a caste-degraded occupation—to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study\, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system’s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of “irregular academic credentials.” The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience\, dignity\, and the quiet power of refusing erasure—of turning art\, memory\, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste\, education\, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome—students\, faculty\, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.
