DESCRIPTION:Scarlet Game Jam is a biannual game jam hosted by the Creation of Games Society at Rutgers University. Similar to any other game jam\, participants will be given one week(ish) to design and code a game to show off at the end of the jam.

Programmers\, musicians\, and artists are welcome\, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around\, the game jam is 2 weeks long to give everyone extra time to work on their games! Feel free to take the whole 2 weeks\, one week\, or even a single day to work on your game. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on April 14th.

It is located at the Livingston Recreation Center MPR A (62 Rd 3\, Piscataway\, NJ 08854). Feel free to come by yourself or with your friends!   Please dress in comfortable clothing that you can freely move around in. You will be able to try out the different props (sword\, fan\, sleeves\, etc) and get to know each other.
