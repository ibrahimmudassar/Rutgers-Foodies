DESCRIPTION:Come see a talk given by Kyan Valencik\, a math undergrad at Rutgers! This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks\; this semester\, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Under mirror symmetry\, there is believed to be a correspondence between Fano manifolds and Laurent polynomials. When this happens\, we say that a Laurent polynomial f is a mirror partner for a Fano manifold X. There is a change of variables known as a “mutation” which yields a family of mirror partners for X from the polynomial f. From this\, we can construct a graph of all possible mutations and ask questions about the graph’s structure. In this talk\, we examine the mutation graph of f=x+y+z+1/xyz corresponding to complex projective three-space.

Publications such as Life\, China Pictorial\, Drum\, Picture Post\, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today\, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications\, showing how their layouts were affected by political\, commercial\, editorial\, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images\, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents\, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andrés Mario Zervigón is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers\, the State University of New Jersey.

Dana Women Artists Series Galleries! Collins is a Brooklyn based artist that works across art and design. She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric\, yarn\, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media. Although she embraces a language of abstraction\, bold colors\, patterns\, and symbols allude to queer and feminist references\, sourcing further inspiration from interpersonal and environmental forces such as electricity\, volatility\, connectivity\, and energy exchange.    Don't miss out—RSVP today and join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass to view the exhibition during a reception and for a talk by artist Liz Collins on October 16\, from 5:00 to 6:30 PM!

CATEGORIES:Cultural,Film ,Graduate Student Organization Event
DESCRIPTION:About the film and discussion:  Anti-caste reformers from Jotiba Phule to Periyar and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression—a route to dignity\, mobility\, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical\, exclusionary\, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal\, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer’s life—a caste-degraded occupation—to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study\, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system’s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of “irregular academic credentials.” The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience\, dignity\, and the quiet power of refusing erasure—of turning art\, memory\, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste\, education\, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome—students\, faculty\, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.

DESCRIPTION:SSPAR is the graduate student talk series at Rutgers where the speakers can present talks on any topic of their choice! Our second speaker of the academic year will be Abay Zhakenov\, who will be presenting on the 15th of October\, at 5:30 pm in SRN 330. As always\, dinner will be provided\, and we'll update this space with the details shortly. Title of talk: No man is an island but the quantum impurity is Abstract: What happens when you drop a single foreign atom into a sea of electrons\, or introduce one lone defect into a perfect crystal? At first glance\, it seems too small to matter. Yet again and again\, physics teaches us the opposite: a solitary “impurity” can reshape the entire ocean around it. In metals\, a single magnetic impurity can capture the attention of millions of electrons\, weaving a hidden cloud of entanglement known as the Kondo effect. In other settings\, impurities bind particles into unexpected quantum states\, creating resonances and new energy scales that change the collective behavior of the whole system. In this talk\, I will explore how these lonely outsiders - quantum impurities - become central players in many-body physics. Through a few vivid examples\, we’ll see how they reveal the richness of quantum matter\, how they act as sensitive probes of their environment\, and how they embody the paradox that sometimes\, the smallest part tells us about the whole.
