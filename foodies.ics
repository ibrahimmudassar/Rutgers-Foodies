DESCRIPTION:The Rutgers Chinese Dance Troupe is a performance group that shares traditional costumes\, customs\, stories\, and dances with the Rutgers community. We welcome all students regardless of background or prior dance experience. In fact\, many of our members started out with no dance experience at all!   Our first General Interest Meeting (GIM) will tentatively take place Friday\, September 6th\, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. It is located at the Livingston Recreation Center MPR A (62 Rd 3\, Piscataway\, NJ 08854). Feel free to come by yourself or with your friends!   Please dress in comfortable clothing that you can freely move around in. You will be able to try out the different props (sword\, fan\, sleeves\, etc) and get to know each other.
