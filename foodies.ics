DESCRIPTION:We hope you’re having a great start to your semester! We are Anakbayan Rutgers\, an on-campus chapter of a mass organization of youth and students fighting to address the struggles of Filipinos – in the Philippines and abroad. We aim to inform others about political issues happening in the Philippines\, and engage with members of the local Filipino Community. But most importantly we strive to educate\, organize\, and mobilize the community\, starting right here at Rutgers\, to fight towards achieving genuine democracy and freedom. Join us after the Involvement Fair (date tbd)\, to not only be given a chance to learn more about Anakbayan but also an opportunity for us to become more engaged in the Rutgers community. We hope that you will join us for all the food and fun activities we will be having for this open house\, and we look forward to meeting you!
