DESCRIPTION:Abstract: Origami is the art of folding pieces of paper into a finished sculpture\, all performed without cutting or gluing. It encompasses all levels of skill\; from napkin swans at restaurants to intricate designs made with hundreds of folds. Behind it all\, however\, is a rich and varied field of mathematical study\, which in the past years has been of considerable interest in numerous fields. My talk is meant to be a small (and fun!) introduction to the mathematics behind origami. We'll go over some simple constructions\, motivate some theorems\, and make you reconsider everything you thought you knew about folding paper. I'll of course bring along some origami paper for you to follow along (or mess around with) during the talk. Just make sure not to ruin them while eating some delicious Delhi Garden food!

The name is inspired by the common abbreviation of Yasher Koach literally meaning "may it be for strength' but colloquially "good job!" You often hear people wishing each other Yasher Koach during times of great simcha (joy) and that is the feeling we want to capture at our social events. Each week we will come together to schmooze with old friends and meet new ones with a different fun activity every time. The best part? Anyone is welcome whether they come every week or it's their first time!
