DESCRIPTION:Our final SSPAR of the semester will be given by Astronomy Ph.D. candidate Lana Eid on her work with gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters.We meet in Serin 330W (the Physics and Astronomy building on Busch campus). This room is directly beneath the observatory dome\, enter on the west side of the building by Allison Rd.Dinner will be provided on a first-come first-serve basis\, we will order food from Evelyn's Restaurant in New Brunswick.Abstract:We aim to use the z=0.725 giant arc lensed by the z=0.375 Abell 370 galaxy cluster in Hubble Frontier Fields data to study the effects of using an extended source model on constraining a cluster lens model. Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters magnifies and distorts distant galaxies\, which can let us study them at higher resolution than otherwise possible. In order to determine the morphology of the source\, the observed images need to be de-lensed. Cluster lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources. We use giant arcs to study the effects of an extended source model on both the cluster mass model and the reconstructed source galaxy. A giant arc provides more constraints than images from an unresolved point source\, but it requires a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the source. We seek to determine whether improvements to the lens model and reconstructed source merit the difficulty of handling the extra constraints. We first present a series of pixel-based source reconstructions for cluster mass models that explore the range of uncertainties in our fiducial model. We additionally compare predicted sources and model arcs from a set of 10 fiducial cluster models from the HFF teams using a simpler delensing code. We then discuss possible avenues to solve the issues we have found in all these models.
