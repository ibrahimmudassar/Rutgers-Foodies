DESCRIPTION:Scarlet Game Jam is a biannual game jam hosted by the Creation of Games Society at Rutgers University. Similar to any other game jam\, participants will be given one week(ish) to design and code a game to show off at the end of the jam.

Programmers\, musicians\, and artists are welcome\, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around\, the game jam is 2 weeks long to give everyone extra time to work on their games! Feel free to take the whole 2 weeks\, one week\, or even a single day to work on your game. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on April 14th.
