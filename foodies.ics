To do or invite timepass is to unmoor oneself from the weight of time\, to surrender (for better or worse) to the process\; all that matters is that time passes and we along with it." -From "Timepass: A (Queer) View From South Asia by Anjali Arondekar

Publications such as Life\, China Pictorial\, Drum\, Picture Post\, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today\, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications\, showing how their layouts were affected by political\, commercial\, editorial\, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images\, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents\, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andrés Mario Zervigón is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers\, the State University of New Jersey.

DESCRIPTION:SSPAR is the graduate student talk series at Rutgers where the speakers can present talks on any topic of their choice! Our second speaker of the academic year will be Abay Zhakenov\, who will be presenting on the 15th of October\, at 5:30 pm in SRN 330. As always\, dinner will be provided\, and we'll update this space with the details shortly. Title of talk: No man is an island but the quantum impurity is Abstract: What happens when you drop a single foreign atom into a sea of electrons\, or introduce one lone defect into a perfect crystal? At first glance\, it seems too small to matter. Yet again and again\, physics teaches us the opposite: a solitary “impurity” can reshape the entire ocean around it. In metals\, a single magnetic impurity can capture the attention of millions of electrons\, weaving a hidden cloud of entanglement known as the Kondo effect. In other settings\, impurities bind particles into unexpected quantum states\, creating resonances and new energy scales that change the collective behavior of the whole system. In this talk\, I will explore how these lonely outsiders - quantum impurities - become central players in many-body physics. Through a few vivid examples\, we’ll see how they reveal the richness of quantum matter\, how they act as sensitive probes of their environment\, and how they embody the paradox that sometimes\, the smallest part tells us about the whole.
