DESCRIPTION:SSPAR is back again for its third installment this semester\, on the 25th of November (Tuesday) at 5:30 pm! Our speaker will be Parijat Banerjee\, and we'll be ordering some delicious Indian food from Delhi Garden! Title: What do you mean you hate jazz? Abstract: ​Why does the simple harmony of a pop song feel fundamentally different from the complex\, "messy" interplay of a bebop line? In La La Land\, Sebastian passionately describes jazz as "conflict and compromise... it's new every time." While this sounds like poetry\, research suggests it may be a quantifiable physical phenomenon. This talk explores a biophysical model of auditory perception that provides a neural basis for the distinction between consonance and dissonance. Join me in the journey to listen to some good music and understand the physics of neural harmony.

DESCRIPTION:Come see a talk given by Michael Fiore\, a math undergrad at Rutgers! This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks\; this semester\, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Classical model theory studies the relationship between statements written in first-order logic and set-theoretic structures which interpret them. Beginning primarily with the work of Shelah\, much of work in the field became dedicated to the herculean task of classifying all first-order theories according to their behavior\, categorized in meaningful ways by certain "dividing lines." We will introduce two characterizations of "good behavior" in first-order theories: stability and NIP\, and present a two-cardinal theorem of Lachlan and Shelah that demonstrates what can be achieved within stable theories.
