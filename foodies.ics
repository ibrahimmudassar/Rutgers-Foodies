The grandmother-grandson relationship that is drifting apart is brought close again as Manawei sings and dances in traditional ethnic costume.  Bathed in the spirit of ‚Äúour culture\, our pride‚Äù\, the film depicts an authentic\, rarely seen side of Orchid Island\, and engages issues of family relationships\, love\, abandonment\, and grandparenting problems against the backdrop of the Yami(Tao) cultural fault line. All characters except the teacher are portrayed by non-professional actors from the Yami(Tao) ethnic group.
