DESCRIPTION:From Oscar®-winning director Ben Proudfoot\, THE EYES OF GHANA is a stunning feature documentary following 93-year-old documentarian Chris Hesse--personal cinematographer to forgotten African icon Kwame Nkrumah--as he races against blindness and time to rescue and repatriate a secret trove of over 1\,300 films that captured the birth of African independence in the fifties and sixties. Yet unseen by the public\, these films may not only rewrite Ghanaian and African history--but world history itself.   The screening will be followed by a live filmmaker Q&A and discussion anchored by Ambassador Abena P.A. Busia (Professor Emerita\, Rutgers). There will be popcorn!   Please RSVP "Yes" on Get Involved by Monday\, November 10 if you plan to attend. Non-RU student/staff may RSVP by emailing sbscenters@sas.rutgers.edu.   Presented by the Center for African Studies and co-sponsored by: The Department of History\, The Busia Foundation International\, Rutgers Global\, and Crossroads Theatre Company.
