Set to take place on Thursday\, February 27th\, from 7:00 to 8:00 PM at the Caps and Skull room in the College Ave Student Center\, this event promises to be a vibrant meeting of minds. We’ll delve into the ethical complexities surrounding reproduction rights\, exploring the multifaceted debate between pro-choice and pro-life perspectives. Our conversation will touch on landmark cases such as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022)\, which overturned Roe v. Wade\, and examine how perspectives vary by age\, gender\, race\, and political affiliation. The discussion will further explore ethical frameworks including Utilitarianism\, Deontology\, and Virtue Ethics to analyze the moral dimensions of these issues. Whether you are passionate about ethical debates\, curious about reproduction rights\, or simply eager to share your perspective on when life begins\, this is the perfect forum for you. And if that isn’t enough\, early attendees will enjoy free boba on a first come\, first served basis! Join us\, voice your opinions\, and be a part of a dynamic conversation that matters.
