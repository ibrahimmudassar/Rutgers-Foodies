Publications such as Life\, China Pictorial\, Drum\, Picture Post\, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today\, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications\, showing how their layouts were affected by political\, commercial\, editorial\, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images\, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents\, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andrés Mario Zervigón is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers\, the State University of New Jersey.

In partnership with Douglass Women in Science & Engineering (WiSE)\, the event will also feature The Science of the Scent. Led by Magy Georges\, Assistant Dean of WiSE\, this interactive activity will explore how fragrance is created\, how it connects to memory and identity\, and how scents from Latin America such as vanilla\, cacao\, coffee\, and citrus have shaped both culture and science. Participants will even get the chance to craft and take home their own unique scent!
