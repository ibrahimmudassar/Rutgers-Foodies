Dr. Joshua Anthony (husband to our own Dr. Tracy Anthony) is the founder and CEO of Nlumn\, a company specializing in business-to-business personalized health/nutrition consultations. He will be presenting on a span of topics\, ranging from the research underpinning personalized nutrition\, to working with the public\, to navigating federal and state regulations. We'll have a change to mingle with him before his seminar and enjoy Efes\, then attend the seminar after. I'm looking forward to seeing you all there!
