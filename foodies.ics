DESCRIPTION:Hi everyone\,  RU Nu Rho Psi's annual research conference\, AXON\, is coming up soon! All students who are conducting neuroscience-related research are invited to present their research projects to an audience for the chance to win cash prizes. This year\, AXON will be held on April 27th from 1230pm - 5pm in room 105 of the Psychology Building on Busch Campus. Students at Rutgers have the option to present their research via presentation of a physical printed poster during a poster session\, or via a 15 minute slideshow presentation (10 minute talk + 5 minutes for questions). Students would not only be able to present their research at a conference recognized by the National Honor Society of Neuroscience\, they would also have the chance to get their presentations judged for the possibility of winning a cash prize (a $150 prize\, a $125 prize\, and a $100 prize will be awarded). Attending and presenting at AXON is completely free\, and food will be provided and catered (food will be catered from Jersey Mikes and Szechwan Ichiban). Students interested in presenting at AXON 5.0 will need to submit their abstracts using the following form by April 19th at 11:59pm: https://forms.gle/6Ro3aqEK1kGeE5cq5   Since the theme of AXON this year is "Exercise and the Brain"\, Dr. Peter Douris\, the keynote speaker\, will be talking about whether exercise is the true ultimate modality for optimal cognitive performance (your neuroscience research does not have to be exercise related). Here is the website dedicated to the conference: https://axon2024.myportfolio.com/. Make sure to check it out. If you have any questions\, feel free to contact nrp.rutgers@gmail.com.

DESCRIPTION:For some background\, IAW\, Islamic Awareness Week\, is a week-long fair held at the heart of our college campus that aims to promote a true image of Islam to the rest of our community\, with the greater intention of spreading interest in the religion and giving Da'wah. We strive to achieve this goal by filling each day with numerous activities that tie back to the overall theme of the week and end the day off with our Shuyookh. Alhamdulillah\, by the grace of Allah swt\, IAW has been operating every year since 2005\, continuing to expand beyond the University's reach and become one of the largest Dawah initiatives held in the Central Jersey community. For a better idea\, attached is a picture of one of the events held during IAW.

We strive to achieve this goal by filling each day with numerous activities that tie back to the overall theme of the week and end the day off with our Shuyookh. Alhamdulillah\, by the grace of Allah swt\, IAW has been operating every year since 2005\, continuing to expand beyond the University's reach and become one of the largest Dawah initiatives held in the Central Jersey community. For a better idea\, attached is a picture of one of the events held during IAW.
