Snacks will be provided!

DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to survive—intellectually\, politically\, ecologically\, or aesthetically—in a moment defined by crisis? When uncertainty and chaos prevail\, those who endure must bend\, not break. They must adapt\, redirect\, stay fluid. How do figures of water help us think survival not as a static state but as a process: precarious\, contingent\, always at risk of being swept under? Survival and water: two conceptual forces that converge in literary\, philosophical\, and political discourses across the German tradition. Whether in the form of biblical floods\, rising oceans\, or mythic rivers—water stages a sight of duality: It is where life and death\, healing and destruction\, calmness and acceleration are able to meet in a resistant stream of becoming. To survive—especially “with one’s head above water”—is to inhabit the threshold between endurance and submersion\, grasping for breath\, clarity\, meaning. At the same time\, survival carries its own paradoxes: Who survives and at what cost? What kinds of knowledge or expression survive catastrophe\, exile\, war\, or erasure—and which are drowned out? Water leaks across genres and disciplines: as metaphor for time and memory\, as site of passage and peril\, as resource and threat\, as a medium of cleansing\, forgetting\, or border-policing. Meanwhile\, survival speaks equally to historical trauma and everyday precarity\, to climate catastrophe and cultural memory\, to the bodies that wash ashore and those that remain submerged in the archive. This conference seeks contributions that take up the dual themes of survival and water—literally\, figuratively\, or formally—as critical frameworks. We welcome engagements with water as metaphor\, medium\, matter\, and menace\, and with survival as a philosophical problem\, a narrative form\, or a historical condition. What does it mean to be in over one’s head—psychically\, politically\, or ecologically? How might “keeping one’s head above water” register both resistance and exhaustion? How are the concepts of water and survival marshaled by thinkers\, writers\, artists\, or regimes? How do literature\, film\, and theory reckon with flood\, immersion\, drowning\, or breath? What kinds of bodies are asked to stay afloat\, and at what cost? Brief: how do we keep our head above water\; how do we survive the current?
