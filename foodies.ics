DESCRIPTION:Picture this: it's late April\, you've survived the job search process\, and now you have at least two job offers to consider before you graduate- congratulations! Then it hits you: how do you figure out which offer is the best offer? Once you accept a position\, what should you reasonably expect from your first day\, week\, and month(s) on the job? You had a four-year plan for high school and college\, but should you make a similar plan now that you're about to be a young professional in the workplace? You've officially entered into your Adulting 101 period of life\, and luckily for you the four Cultural Centers on campus and CES have collaborated to provide you with a panel discussion to answer these and many other Adulting 101 questions.   During this event you will: -hear from HR and employment experts on topics like offer negotiations and HR -speak with industry aficionados about must-know resources to leverage to have the best experience possible during your first few months on the job -strategize moves to make early in your career to set yourself up for successful goal-setting and advancement   This event is part of the #Rutgersworks Free Tuition Challenge. By attending this event\, you will earn one stamp toward your Spring 2024 gameboard. Visit careers.rutgers.edu/challenge for more information.

Although climate change is a global problem that is rooted in the structure of our economy and industries\, this assessment hopefully gives us a way forward to focus on reducing the harm. This seminar will also have an interactive portion (so bring your laptops!). We will use the MIT EN-ROADS simulator and act as certain sectors while trying to reduce global emissions below +2 degrees C by 2100."
