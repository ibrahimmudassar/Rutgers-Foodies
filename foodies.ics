DESCRIPTION:Our Mission at REA is to connect undergraduate students with the vast Ecuadorian Alumni and Professional Network. Many Latinos and Latinas are often first-generation or come from distinct\, underrepresented backgrounds. Thus\, navigating one's career path alone involves tough challenges. We intend for this professional panel to unite the experienced with those seeking wisdom and knowledge in their careers of interest. In doing so\, we will raise awareness of the importance of educational and professional pursuits\, fostering a community of post-grads to give back to fellow Ecuadorians.
