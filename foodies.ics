DESCRIPTION:We're happy to announce that our first blood drive of the semester on campus is scheduled on September 13th and 14th at the Yard on College Avenue. We feel great pride that Rutger's UBI is able to help in this beautiful drive hosted by Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health. Today\, the country confronts new challenges that disrupt the blood supply. As concerns compound\, blood centers nationwide are facing a decline in donor turnout\, and donor eligibility misinformation. Yet the need for blood remains constant. We need youth like you to donate and save a life!  Donors will receive a $5 coffee gift card\, a jersey mikes sub\, a t-shirt\, and a chance to win 1 out of 4 $25 WaWa Gift cards!
