DESCRIPTION:Rutgers University Student Assembly (RUSA) is the student government for the undergraduate student body of Rutgers University New Brunswick. We provide representation\, advocacy\, and allocations to support the undergraduate experience! Throughout the course of Halloweekend\, our student body engages in celebratory activities\, which puts some students at risk of engaging in heavy episodic drinking. MidKnight Snacks is a RUSA initiative that seeks to minimize the effects of this by providing food and drink to lessen the effects of drinking during these celebrations. Anyone and everyone can feel free to stop by for free food and drink as they begin their festivities this Halloweekend!
