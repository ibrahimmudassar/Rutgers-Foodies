DESCRIPTION:Are you ready to dive into some of today’s most pressing issues and learn how to navigate the complexities of our diverse world? The "Dialogue Through Difference" series is your chance to do just that! In a time when topics like geo-politics conflicts\, reproductive rights\, affirmative action\, and the upcoming election create deep divides\, it’s more important than ever to engage in meaningful conversations that bridge our differences. Douglass Residential College is offering a 4-week workshop series designed to equip you with the tools and understanding to build empathy\, inclusion\, and collaboration within our community. Students must attend all workshops in order to complete the program for DRC DEI Credit

DESCRIPTION:Please join us for lunch from Merey as Becca talks us through her research and experience!  Genetic evidence supports that the polarity protein\, partitioning defective 1c (Par1c)\, also known as microtubule affinity regulating kinase 1 (MARK1)\, functions in higher level cognition. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MARK1 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and bipolar disorder. Furthermore\, MARK1 is highly expressed in forebrain pyramidal neurons and exhibits human-specific accelerated evolution\, suggesting its importance in the development of cognition. Par1c mediates synaptic plasticity in vitro through phosphorylation of PSD95. However\, whether Par1c is required for the induction or maintenance of synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here\, I will discuss my work developing a novel\, synaptic-targeted photoactivatable Par1c (paPar1c). Future studies will use paPar1c to determine if synaptic plasticity induction requires Par1c activation.
