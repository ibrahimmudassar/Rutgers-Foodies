DESCRIPTION:Shkoach is the Koach (Conservative/Traditional Egalitarian) community's weekly social event. The name is inspired by the common abbreviation of Yasher Koach literally meaning "may it be for strength' but colloquially "good job!" You often hear people wishing each other Yasher Koach during times of great simcha (joy) and that is the feeling we want to capture at our social events. Each week we will come together to schmooze with old friends and meet new ones with a different fun activity every time. The best part? Anyone is welcome whether they come every week or it's their first time!
