DESCRIPTION:Event 1Title: Identidades h√≠bridas y (des/re)territorializaci√≥n en la literatura hispana y sus exilios (1939‚Äì1979)Date & Time: Wednesday\, May 1st\, 10:30 a.m.Location: Academic Building West\, Room 5050Language: SpanishIn this lecture\, Dr. Enrique Mu√±oz-Mantas (University of North Dakota) will explore the formation of hybrid identities and the processes of (dis/re)territorialization in Hispanic literature written in exile between 1939 and 1979. Drawing from transatlantic and decolonial frameworks\, the talk will examine how writers displaced by the Spanish Civil War and subsequent dictatorships negotiated cultural memory\, spatial dislocation\, and linguistic identity. Dr. Mu√±oz-Mantas will highlight the aesthetic and political strategies through which exiled authors reframed notions of homeland\, authorship\, and subjectivity across fragmented geographies. The presentation will be of special interest to those working on exile studies\, Latin American and Iberian literature\, and political aesthetics.   Event 2Title: De doctorando a doctor en el mercado laboral en Estados Unidos: estrategias clave y recursosDate & Time: Wednesday\, May 1st\, 5:00 p.m.Location: Academic Building West\, Room 5190Language: SpanishThis professional development workshop\, led by Dr. Enrique Mu√±oz-Mantas\, offers an in-depth\, practical session for graduate students preparing for the academic job market in the United States. With a focus on the particular challenges faced by international and bilingual candidates\, the workshop will address key strategies for assembling competitive job materials\, navigating hiring practices in U.S. academia\, and translating graduate training into viable professional profiles. Attendees will also learn about essential resources and institutional expectations to support a successful transition from doctoral studies to academic careers. The workshop will include time for Q&A and personalized discussion\, making it especially valuable for students in the final stages of their doctoral journey.

DESCRIPTION:Event 1Title: Identidades h√≠bridas y (des/re)territorializaci√≥n en la literatura hispana y sus exilios (1939‚Äì1979)Date & Time: Wednesday\, May 1st\, 10:30 a.m.Location: Academic Building West\, Room 5050Language: SpanishIn this lecture\, Dr. Enrique Mu√±oz-Mantas (University of North Dakota) will explore the formation of hybrid identities and the processes of (dis/re)territorialization in Hispanic literature written in exile between 1939 and 1979. Drawing from transatlantic and decolonial frameworks\, the talk will examine how writers displaced by the Spanish Civil War and subsequent dictatorships negotiated cultural memory\, spatial dislocation\, and linguistic identity. Dr. Mu√±oz-Mantas will highlight the aesthetic and political strategies through which exiled authors reframed notions of homeland\, authorship\, and subjectivity across fragmented geographies. The presentation will be of special interest to those working on exile studies\, Latin American and Iberian literature\, and political aesthetics.   Event 2Title: De doctorando a doctor en el mercado laboral en Estados Unidos: estrategias clave y recursosDate & Time: Wednesday\, May 1st\, 5:00 p.m.Location: Academic Building West\, Room 5190Language: SpanishThis professional development workshop\, led by Dr. Enrique Mu√±oz-Mantas\, offers an in-depth\, practical session for graduate students preparing for the academic job market in the United States.

Attendees will also learn about essential resources and institutional expectations to support a successful transition from doctoral studies to academic careers. The workshop will include time for Q&A and personalized discussion\, making it especially valuable for students in the final stages of their doctoral journey.
