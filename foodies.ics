The name is inspired by the common abbreviation of Yasher Koach literally meaning "may it be for strength' but colloquially "good job!" You often hear people wishing each other Yasher Koach during times of great simcha (joy) and that is the feeling we want to capture at our social events. Each week we will come together to schmooze with old friends and meet new ones with a different fun activity every time. The best part? Anyone is welcome whether they come every week or it's their first time!

DESCRIPTION:Assalamoalaikum! AMSAW is back with its weekly workshop called Coffee\, Cake\, and True Islam! This workshop aims to dispel misconceptions about Islam by answering any questions you may have about it while enjoying free donuts. It also aims to educate and generate discussions in order to foster a better understanding of Islam. Feel free to ask us anything such as jihad\, shariah law\, women's rights or anything you want to learn about Islam. Everyone is free to come! We are holding this workshop for the entire semester\, every Thursday\, at the table in the Livingston Student Center. We can’t wait to see you there!
