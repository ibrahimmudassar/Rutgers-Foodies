DESCRIPTION:Join us for an exciting cricket match accompanied by explanation\, commentary\, and a Q&A provided by the event's planner and host\, Ammar!   What? Screening of a USA vs Pakistan match in the Cricket T20 World Cup Where? 3rd Floor Graduate Classroom (Room 313) When? February 10\, Tuesday\, from 8:15AM to 11:30AM. There will be an in-depth cricket explainer around 8:15AM by Ammar and a Q/A about everything cricket will be running all throughout the game. Feel free to drop in and out. He will have us leave knowing how the sport works\, as well as its connection to politics more broadly.  Why? Cricket is incredibly fun and\, depending on who's playing\, often intensely political too. Believe it or not\, last time these two teams played each other in the World Cup it was an absolute nail-biter where\, unbeknownst to most of their compatriots\, Team USA (or\, more accurately\, Team South Asian Americans) pulled off an incredible upset and beat Pakistan at the end. Snacks will be provided!

DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to survive—intellectually\, politically\, ecologically\, or aesthetically—in a moment defined by crisis? When uncertainty and chaos prevail\, those who endure must bend\, not break. They must adapt\, redirect\, stay fluid. How do figures of water help us think survival not as a static state but as a process: precarious\, contingent\, always at risk of being swept under? Survival and water: two conceptual forces that converge in literary\, philosophical\, and political discourses across the German tradition. Whether in the form of biblical floods\, rising oceans\, or mythic rivers—water stages a sight of duality: It is where life and death\, healing and destruction\, calmness and acceleration are able to meet in a resistant stream of becoming. To survive—especially “with one’s head above water”—is to inhabit the threshold between endurance and submersion\, grasping for breath\, clarity\, meaning. At the same time\, survival carries its own paradoxes: Who survives and at what cost? What kinds of knowledge or expression survive catastrophe\, exile\, war\, or erasure—and which are drowned out? Water leaks across genres and disciplines: as metaphor for time and memory\, as site of passage and peril\, as resource and threat\, as a medium of cleansing\, forgetting\, or border-policing. Meanwhile\, survival speaks equally to historical trauma and everyday precarity\, to climate catastrophe and cultural memory\, to the bodies that wash ashore and those that remain submerged in the archive. This conference seeks contributions that take up the dual themes of survival and water—literally\, figuratively\, or formally—as critical frameworks. We welcome engagements with water as metaphor\, medium\, matter\, and menace\, and with survival as a philosophical problem\, a narrative form\, or a historical condition. What does it mean to be in over one’s head—psychically\, politically\, or ecologically? How might “keeping one’s head above water” register both resistance and exhaustion? How are the concepts of water and survival marshaled by thinkers\, writers\, artists\, or regimes? How do literature\, film\, and theory reckon with flood\, immersion\, drowning\, or breath? What kinds of bodies are asked to stay afloat\, and at what cost? Brief: how do we keep our head above water\; how do we survive the current?
