DESCRIPTION:From Oscar®-winning director Ben Proudfoot\, THE EYES OF GHANA is a stunning feature documentary following 93-year-old documentarian Chris Hesse--personal cinematographer to forgotten African icon Kwame Nkrumah--as he races against blindness and time to rescue and repatriate a secret trove of over 1\,300 films that captured the birth of African independence in the fifties and sixties. Yet unseen by the public\, these films may not only rewrite Ghanaian and African history--but world history itself.   The screening will be followed by a live filmmaker Q&A and discussion anchored by Ambassador Abena P.A. Busia (Professor Emerita\, Rutgers). There will be popcorn!   Please RSVP "Yes" on Get Involved by Monday\, November 10 if you plan to attend. Non-RU student/staff may RSVP by emailing sbscenters@sas.rutgers.edu.   Presented by the Center for African Studies and co-sponsored by: The Department of History\, The Busia Foundation International\, Rutgers Global\, and Crossroads Theatre Company.

DESCRIPTION:About the film and discussion:  Anti-caste reformers from Jotiba Phule to Periyar and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression—a route to dignity\, mobility\, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical\, exclusionary\, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal\, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer’s life—a caste-degraded occupation—to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study\, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system’s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of “irregular academic credentials.” The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience\, dignity\, and the quiet power of refusing erasure—of turning art\, memory\, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste\, education\, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome—students\, faculty\, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.

DESCRIPTION:Come see a talk given by Professor Tim Bates from the Rutgers math department! Abstract below.--A planar graph is a connected graph which can be drawn in the plane without any edges crossing (we call this a planar embedding of the graph. We know that any planar embedding will satisfy Euler's formula (v-e=2-f)\, so no matter how the graph is embedded\, I can tell you exactly how many complementary regions of the graph there will be. So we are able to express topological information about the embedding from combinatorial information of the graph. Any graph can be embedded into 3-dimensional space (we call such an embedding a spatial graph)\, and while we have more freedom when embedding into 3-dimensional space\, a lot of topological information about the embedding depends on the structure of the abstract graph. For example\, I'll prove that the complete graph on 6 vertices is intrinsically linked (a result due to Conway and Gordon).
