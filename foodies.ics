DESCRIPTION:Abstract: "In this talk\, I (as a grad student with an astrophysics background) will review some of the key figures and plans outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report. Although climate change is a global problem that is rooted in the structure of our economy and industries\, this assessment hopefully gives us a way forward to focus on reducing the harm. This seminar will also have an interactive portion (so bring your laptops!). We will use the MIT EN-ROADS simulator and act as certain sectors while trying to reduce global emissions below +2 degrees C by 2100."
