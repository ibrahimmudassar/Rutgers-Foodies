DESCRIPTION:Come see a talk given by Michael Fiore\, a math undergrad at Rutgers! This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks\; this semester\, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Classical model theory studies the relationship between statements written in first-order logic and set-theoretic structures which interpret them. Beginning primarily with the work of Shelah\, much of work in the field became dedicated to the herculean task of classifying all first-order theories according to their behavior\, categorized in meaningful ways by certain "dividing lines." We will introduce two characterizations of "good behavior" in first-order theories: stability and NIP\, and present a two-cardinal theorem of Lachlan and Shelah that demonstrates what can be achieved within stable theories.
