DESCRIPTION:Please join us to see and discuss the Colombian documentary The Way Back in the Maloca\, directed by √ìscar Aponte. In the heart of the Amazon rainforest\, the Murui-Muina people of Legu√≠zamo\, Colombia\, defend their culture and traditions after surviving the genocide perpetrated by the rubber company Casa Arana. In a sound and visual journey through the rivers and jungles of Amazonia\, The Way Back to the Maloca documents the life of the Murui-Muina people in night ceremonies\, agricultural plots\, malocas\, classrooms\, traditional dances\, and daily conversations. Will the Murui-Muina people succeed in rescuing their ancestral knowledge and passing it down to the new generations? √ìscar is an interdisciplinary scholar and filmmaker with a history\, sociology\, and anthropology background. Currently\, he is a Ph.D. candidate in Latin American and Caribbean History at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
