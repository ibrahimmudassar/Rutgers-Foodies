DESCRIPTION:Join JVCA as we appreciate two recently released Japanese short films\, Look Back (2024) and Summer Ghost (2021)! This event will have free pizza and drinks\, so be sure to stop by our last meeting of the semester! Read some reviews of the movies below: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a haiku-like purity to it: Look Back is as neat and yet also as overflowing as the four-panel strips in which its leads once diligently honed their craft. And if something so beautiful also feels too brief ‚Äì well\, that may be the idea.‚Äù -Robbie Collin\, The Telegraph ‚ÄúSummer Ghost is an incredibly profound and emotionally moving film. It left a deep impression on me\, especially since I‚Äôve felt almost numb to emotions lately. However\, this movie was different‚Äîit pushed me forward in ways I didn‚Äôt expect. After watching it\, I came to a powerful realization: my life matters... It also teaches us to follow our dreams and live with purpose. Even though I don‚Äôt fully understand what love feels like\, the emotions in this film touched me in a way that feels rare and special. It‚Äôs not just a movie\; it‚Äôs a reminder of the beauty and potential in life.‚Äù -Srv Frosti\, Google Reviews
