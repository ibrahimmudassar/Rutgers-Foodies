DESCRIPTION:Stuart Cattel is a graduate student in Dr. James Millonig’s lab and in the Graduate Program in Neuroscience at Rutgers University. He earned his BA in Neuroscience from Franklin & Marshall College. Following his graduation from F&M\, Stuart worked for two years as a Research Assistant in Dr. David Ginty’s lab at Harvard Medical School studying the ultrastructural features of somatosensory end-organs in the skin and their potential role in touch-sensing mechanotransduction. Come hear about Stuart's current research which combines a multi-omic bioinformatic approach with traditional wet lab techniques to understand whether dysregulation to common biochemical pathways underpins neurological phenotypes seen across genetic (16p11.2del) and idiopathic cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Through this experience\, Mitsuha and Taki learn many interesting things about themselves\, the opposite sex and human\, emotional connections." - Diana Tuova\, Spotlight on Film
