DESCRIPTION:Join us for a conversation with Dr. Nichole Garcia (Assistant Professor of Higher Education and College Student Affairs at Rutgers University) about her recent book Latinx Students in Higher Education (2021).  As a Chicana/Puerto Rican her research focuses on the intersections of race\, Feminisms of Color\, and Latinx/a/o communities in higher education. Specifically\, she conducts comparative studies on Chicana/o ad Puerto Rican college-educated families to advance narratives of intergenerational achievement and college choice processes. Garcia is an alum of the Ronald E. McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement program which she credits for putting her on the path to graduate school. She received her Ph.D. in Social Science and Comparative Education with a specialization in Race and Ethnic Studies from the University of California\, Los Angeles. Garcia has published in Race\, Ethnicity\, and Education\, The Journal of Latinos in Education\, Journal of Hispanic Higher Education\, and Frontiers. She is an avid blogger for Diverse Issues in Higher Education\, and writes the college preparation column for Motivos\, a bilingual magazine for Latinx high school students throughout the nation. Presented by CLAC as part of its Faculty Appreciation Series. Food and refreshments served.  This Faculty Appreciation Series is designed to highlight the work of Latinx/e faculty at Rutgers and allow students to interact with engaged faculty members in a comfortable setting outside of the classroom.
