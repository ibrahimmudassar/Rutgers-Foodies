Through this experience\, Mitsuha and Taki learn many interesting things about themselves\, the opposite sex and human\, emotional connections." - Diana Tuova\, Spotlight on Film

DESCRIPTION:Stuart Cattel is a graduate student in Dr. James Millonig’s lab and in the Graduate Program in Neuroscience at Rutgers University. He earned his BA in Neuroscience from Franklin & Marshall College. Following his graduation from F&M\, Stuart worked for two years as a Research Assistant in Dr. David Ginty’s lab at Harvard Medical School studying the ultrastructural features of somatosensory end-organs in the skin and their potential role in touch-sensing mechanotransduction. Come hear about Stuart's current research which combines a multi-omic bioinformatic approach with traditional wet lab techniques to understand whether dysregulation to common biochemical pathways underpins neurological phenotypes seen across genetic (16p11.2del) and idiopathic cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
