DESCRIPTION:Please join us for lunch from Merey as Becca talks us through her research and experience!  Genetic evidence supports that the polarity protein\, partitioning defective 1c (Par1c)\, also known as microtubule affinity regulating kinase 1 (MARK1)\, functions in higher level cognition. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MARK1 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and bipolar disorder. Furthermore\, MARK1 is highly expressed in forebrain pyramidal neurons and exhibits human-specific accelerated evolution\, suggesting its importance in the development of cognition. Par1c mediates synaptic plasticity in vitro through phosphorylation of PSD95. However\, whether Par1c is required for the induction or maintenance of synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here\, I will discuss my work developing a novel\, synaptic-targeted photoactivatable Par1c (paPar1c). Future studies will use paPar1c to determine if synaptic plasticity induction requires Par1c activation.

DESCRIPTION:Scarlet Game Jam is a biannual game jam hosted by the Creation of Games Society at Rutgers University. Similar to any other game jam\, participants will be given one week(ish) to design and code a game to show off at the end of the jam. At the beginning of each Scarlet Game Jam\, we will also be unveiling the (optional) theme to inspire or challenge our participants\, which changes with every Scarlet Game Jam\, so each year is a new experience! Programmers\, musicians\, and artists are welcome\, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around\, the game jam is 2 weeks long to give everyone extra time to work on their games! Feel free to take the whole 2 weeks\, one week\, or even a single day to work on your game. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on April 14th.
