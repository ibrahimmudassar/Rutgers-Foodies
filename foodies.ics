DESCRIPTION:SSPAR is the graduate student talk series at Rutgers where the speakers can present talks on any topic of their choice! Our second speaker of the academic year will be Abay Zhakenov\, who will be presenting on the 15th of October\, at 5:30 pm in SRN 330. As always\, dinner will be provided\, and we'll update this space with the details shortly. Title of talk: No man is an island but the quantum impurity is Abstract: What happens when you drop a single foreign atom into a sea of electrons\, or introduce one lone defect into a perfect crystal? At first glance\, it seems too small to matter. Yet again and again\, physics teaches us the opposite: a solitary ‚Äúimpurity‚Äù can reshape the entire ocean around it. In metals\, a single magnetic impurity can capture the attention of millions of electrons\, weaving a hidden cloud of entanglement known as the Kondo effect. In other settings\, impurities bind particles into unexpected quantum states\, creating resonances and new energy scales that change the collective behavior of the whole system. In this talk\, I will explore how these lonely outsiders - quantum impurities - become central players in many-body physics. Through a few vivid examples\, we‚Äôll see how they reveal the richness of quantum matter\, how they act as sensitive probes of their environment\, and how they embody the paradox that sometimes\, the smallest part tells us about the whole.

CATEGORIES:Cultural,Film ,Graduate Student Organization Event
DESCRIPTION:About the film and discussion:  Anti-caste reformers from Jotiba Phule to Periyar and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression‚Äîa route to dignity\, mobility\, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical\, exclusionary\, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal\, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer‚Äôs life‚Äîa caste-degraded occupation‚Äîto become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study\, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system‚Äôs retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of ‚Äúirregular academic credentials.‚Äù The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience\, dignity\, and the quiet power of refusing erasure‚Äîof turning art\, memory\, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste\, education\, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome‚Äîstudents\, faculty\, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.

DESCRIPTION:Stop by Douglass Library to experience a solo exhibition of artwork by the 2025-2026 Lebowitz Artist-in-Residence\, Liz Collins\, on view September 2 through March 13 in the Mary H. Dana Women Artists Series Galleries! Collins is a Brooklyn based artist that works across art and design. She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric\, yarn\, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media. Although she embraces a language of abstraction\, bold colors\, patterns\, and symbols allude to queer and feminist references\, sourcing further inspiration from interpersonal and environmental forces such as electricity\, volatility\, connectivity\, and energy exchange.    Don't miss out‚ÄîRSVP today and join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass to view the exhibition during a reception and for a talk by artist Liz Collins on October 16\, from 5:00 to 6:30 PM!

DESCRIPTION:Jesus Awareness Day is a celebration of faith and renewal ‚Äî a time for everyone to rediscover the love and presence of God in their lives. Through five interactive stations\, guests will explore the message of renewal in a welcoming\, open environment. The goal of the day is simple: to evangelize not by judgment\, but by love. We want every person who attends to leave feeling uplifted\, valued\, and reminded that they are deeply loved and appreciated by God. This isn‚Äôt about being told what we‚Äôre doing wrong\, but about realizing how much we matter to Him and how He continuously invites us to grow and renew our hearts. Whether you‚Äôre just curious or deeply rooted in your faith\, Jesus Awareness Day is a space to experience the beauty of God‚Äôs love\, connect with others\, and take a step toward spiritual renewal.

Wednesday\, October 15\, 2025\, 5.30 ‚Äì 7.00 PM Art History Graduate Student Lounge\, Vorhees Hall\, 71 Hamilton Street\, New Brunswick   Print Matters: Media and Modernity in Illustrated Magazines\, 1910‚Äì1970Edited by Maria Antonella Pelizzari and Andr√©s Mario Zervig√≥n Available November 2025 In the early to mid-twentieth century\, the vast majority of printed photographs appeared in the pages of illustrated magazines. Publications such as Life\, China Pictorial\, Drum\, Picture Post\, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today\, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications\, showing how their layouts were affected by political\, commercial\, editorial\, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images\, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents\, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andr√©s Mario Zervig√≥n is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers\, the State University of New Jersey.
