DESCRIPTION:Please join us in the screening and discussion of the documentary Spaces of Exception (2018) directed by Matt Peterson and Malek Rasamny. Spaces of Exception investigates and juxtaposes the struggles\, communities\, and spaces of the American Indian reservation and the Palestinian refugee camp. The film was shot from 2014 to 2017 in Arizona\, New Mexico\, New York\, and South Dakota\, as well as in Lebanon and the West Bank. It is an attempt to understand the significance of the land—its memory and divisions—and the conditions for life\, community\, and sovereignty.
