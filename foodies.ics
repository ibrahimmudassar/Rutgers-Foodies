DESCRIPTION:RUSynapse is a program where we pair pre-medical Rutgers students with medical student mentors at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. The goal of this is to provide pre-medical students with an additional resource as they navigate their pre-medical years and the medical school application process. In addition to being paired with a mentor\, several mentor-mentee pairs will be "bundled together" based on some answers to this form. This will give students access to individualized help from their own mentor\, as well as expertise on a wide variety of topics from multiple medical students. As of now\, this program is prioritizing sophomores and above\, but freshman can still apply!   Please fill out the form below by Friday\, March 8th at 11:59 pm in its entirety so that we can best match you to a mentor and bundle that meet your needs and goals. All information will be kept confidential and will only be shared with the medical student coordinators and your individual mentor.     https://forms.gle/ysuzhVk5Ki6g94aeA   We look forward to reading your responses!   If you have any questions\, please email Namarata Battula (nb638@rwjms.rutgers.edu)\, Hunter Skroczky (hs1154@rwjms.rutgers.edu)\, or Parth Modi (pm783@rwjms.rutgers.edu).

Although climate change is a global problem that is rooted in the structure of our economy and industries\, this assessment hopefully gives us a way forward to focus on reducing the harm. This seminar will also have an interactive portion (so bring your laptops!). We will use the MIT EN-ROADS simulator and act as certain sectors while trying to reduce global emissions below +2 degrees C by 2100."

DESCRIPTION:Picture this: it's late April\, you've survived the job search process\, and now you have at least two job offers to consider before you graduate- congratulations!

You've officially entered into your Adulting 101 period of life\, and luckily for you the four Cultural Centers on campus and CES have collaborated to provide you with a panel discussion to answer these and many other Adulting 101 questions.   During this event you will: -hear from HR and employment experts on topics like offer negotiations and HR -speak with industry aficionados about must-know resources to leverage to have the best experience possible during your first few months on the job -strategize moves to make early in your career to set yourself up for successful goal-setting and advancement   This event is part of the #Rutgersworks Free Tuition Challenge. By attending this event\, you will earn one stamp toward your Spring 2024 gameboard. Visit careers.rutgers.edu/challenge for more information.
