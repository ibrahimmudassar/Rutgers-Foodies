DESCRIPTION:SSPAR is back again for its third installment this semester\, on the 25th of November (Tuesday) at 5:30 pm! Our speaker will be Parijat Banerjee\, and we'll be ordering some delicious Indian food from Delhi Garden! Title: What do you mean you hate jazz? Abstract: ​Why does the simple harmony of a pop song feel fundamentally different from the complex\, "messy" interplay of a bebop line? In La La Land\, Sebastian passionately describes jazz as "conflict and compromise... it's new every time." While this sounds like poetry\, research suggests it may be a quantifiable physical phenomenon. This talk explores a biophysical model of auditory perception that provides a neural basis for the distinction between consonance and dissonance. Join me in the journey to listen to some good music and understand the physics of neural harmony.
