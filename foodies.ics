DESCRIPTION:Abstract: Origami is the art of folding pieces of paper into a finished sculpture\, all performed without cutting or gluing. It encompasses all levels of skill\; from napkin swans at restaurants to intricate designs made with hundreds of folds. Behind it all\, however\, is a rich and varied field of mathematical study\, which in the past years has been of considerable interest in numerous fields. My talk is meant to be a small (and fun!) introduction to the mathematics behind origami. We'll go over some simple constructions\, motivate some theorems\, and make you reconsider everything you thought you knew about folding paper. I'll of course bring along some origami paper for you to follow along (or mess around with) during the talk. Just make sure not to ruin them while eating some delicious Delhi Garden food!

DESCRIPTION:Celebrate the end of the academic year by joining Douglass staff\, the Voorhees Choir\, and fellow students for the annual Sacred Path Ceremony. One of Douglass' oldest traditions\, the Sacred Path ceremony recognizes student achievement and fosters Douglass's unique community.

Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white\, sophomores wear pink\, juniors wear red\, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm\, a token representing her class. All Douglass students\, family\, faculty\, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements*
