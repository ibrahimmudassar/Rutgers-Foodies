CATEGORIES:ThoughtfulLearning,College Ave,Educational Lecture
DESCRIPTION:The goal of this tour is to highlight Israelis and Palestinians who are dedicated to promoting a vision for the future that is founded on values of human rights and peace for all. We hope that by bringing Israelis and Palestinians who are committed to talking and working together\, they can be an example for us and help to depolarize our own campus community.     About New Story Leadership Since 2009\, NSL has annually brought 10 Israeli and Palestinian delegates to Washington where they lived together with host families\, worked together on Capitol Hill\, and trained together with DC’s best. They told their stories and advocated for their shared homeland throughout Congress\, foreign embassies\, the State Department\, and faith-based audiences across the Washington DC area. NSL has been proud to elevate the voices of the next generation of leaders committed to working together for justice and peace.    October 7th and its aftermath changed everything. Soon after the war started they reached out to their alumni to check on their safety and ask them what they would like NSL to do. Ten brave NSL alumni -  Muslim\, Jewish\, and Christian -  from Israel and Palestine\, decided to move forward together. After months of research\, discussion and an intense week together in Geneva\, these young leaders negotiated and drafted the Phoenix Plan. This plan calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities and the freeing of all hostages.  However\, it goes much further than that.  The Phoenix Plan sets forth a roadmap for what needs to happen after the fighting stops as agreed upon by young Israelis and Palestinians.  It sets forth a real plan forward for peace\, justice\, security and self-determination for both Palestinians and Israelis for generations to come.      Yonatan Belik is an Australian-Israeli with a passion for peace. He has participated in initiatives like New Story Leadership and Seeds of Peace where he learned the importance of coexistence and shared his story in front of Congress and Diplomats. He's also dedicated to content creation and travels the world sharing his message of mutual understanding\, love\, and peace.    Rawan Odeh is a Palestinian-American from Hewara and currently works for monday.com as a Partnerships Manager for social impact. Prior to joining monday.com\, Rawan was the Executive Director of New Story Leadership and was a participant of the program back in 2015. Rawan is passionate about sharing her story and her message of a joint Israeli/Palestinian political vision for peace. She has spoken at many J Street events as well as Hillels across the country.
