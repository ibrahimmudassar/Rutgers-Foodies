DESCRIPTION:Nusrath is a fourth year Neuroscience PhD candidate in Dr. Kevin Monahan's lab and was recently awarded the NIH F31 grant. Congratulations Nusrath! Olfactory sensory neurons (OSs) express olfactory receptors (ORs) in a monogenic and monoallelic manner and work in various combinations to detect a range of smells. The gene regulation processes by which a singular olfactory receptor gene is chosen needs to be further elucidated. Tex15 is transiently expressed during the critical gene regulation window during ON development. We hypothesize that Tex15 is regulating olfactory receptor gene choice through either methylation patterns or through its effect on chromatin state of developing olfactory sensory neurons. We find that when Tex15 is knocked out\, there is a dramatic reduction in the diversity of expressed OR genes\, with only a few OR genes dominating stochastic choice. This project elucidates a novel aspect of how OSNs come to stochastically choose a single OR and how Tex15 gene and protein guides this specific yet diverse choice.
