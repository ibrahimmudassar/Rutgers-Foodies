She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric\, yarn\, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media.

CATEGORIES:Cultural,Film ,Graduate Student Organization Event
DESCRIPTION:About the film and discussion:  Anti-caste reformers from Jotiba Phule to Periyar and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression—a route to dignity\, mobility\, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical\, exclusionary\, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal\, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer’s life—a caste-degraded occupation—to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study\, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system’s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of “irregular academic credentials.” The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience\, dignity\, and the quiet power of refusing erasure—of turning art\, memory\, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste\, education\, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome—students\, faculty\, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.

DESCRIPTION:Come see a talk given by Kyan Valencik\, a math undergrad at Rutgers! This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks\; this semester\, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Under mirror symmetry\, there is believed to be a correspondence between Fano manifolds and Laurent polynomials. When this happens\, we say that a Laurent polynomial f is a mirror partner for a Fano manifold X. There is a change of variables known as a “mutation” which yields a family of mirror partners for X from the polynomial f. From this\, we can construct a graph of all possible mutations and ask questions about the graph’s structure. In this talk\, we examine the mutation graph of f=x+y+z+1/xyz corresponding to complex projective three-space.

You don't have to be performing to attend\, so come out and support our performers! ♡ Let's cheer each other on and enjoy each other's company! You may also get some sweet treats from us to enjoy while watching performances 👀 Our showcase is also livestreamed on our YouTube page for audience members who cannot attend in person\, but would love to support our performers!
