DESCRIPTION:HackHERS is the annual women-centric hackathon at Rutgers University\, organized by Rutgers Women in Computer Science. We want to create a space where women can explore tech culture and be empowered to create with code\, and we invite everyone to help us achieve that. HackHERS will be held at Trayes Hall at the Douglass Student Center this year. We use the inclusive definition of “women” and “female\,” and we welcome trans women\, genderqueer women\, and non-binary people.
