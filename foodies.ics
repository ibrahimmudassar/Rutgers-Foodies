CATEGORIES:ThoughtfulLearning,Educational Lecture,Special Interest
DESCRIPTION:Despite efforts to educate people about the risks of opioid and other drug use\, drug use remains common. There is a need to better understand how people think about these risks. Previous research suggests that people are generally optimistic and expect more good than bad outcomes. However\, it is unclear whether people with addiction hold a specific form of optimism bias related to drug use and how this bias is maintained over time. To address this\, we used cognitive tasks and models combined with fMRI to evaluate how treatment-engaged patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and healthy individuals think about their chances of various negative outcomes due to drug use or other reasons. We found that patients with OUD held biased (optimistic) beliefs about the risks of drug use\, and these biases were reliable despite engaging in treatment that incorporates elements of psychoeducation. Using fMRI\, we tested how biased belief updating about drug use emerges in the brain. We found that neural responses in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex reflected the relative weighting and integration of biased information about errors in one’s risk estimation when updating beliefs about those risks\, with this mechanism shared between drug-related and nondrug-related outcomes. To examine how long biased (optimistic) beliefs about drug use are maintained in patients with OUD\, we re-assessed these biases repeatedly in a 4-week “task-based” post-fMRI smartphone study as patients engaged in their day-to-day lives. Preliminary findings suggested that optimistic beliefs about drug-use are surprisingly durable over time. Collectively\, these findings suggest that we may be able to improve our understanding of addiction and efforts to educate people about the risks of drug use by considering the cognitive neuroscience of optimism and belief change.
