For this event, the McNair Program will be present to share opportunities for Graduate School / Research Exploration for First Gen., Low Income and Underrepresented students at Rutgers New Brunswick. This is an opportunity for students to utilize the resources at the PRCC, de-stress, meet other students, organize themselves for the fall semester, or simply relax at the PRCC. Please note breakfast starts at 9:30am and will end when all the food is gone which is typically between 11am-12pm. ",
