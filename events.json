The event fosters an atmosphere of peace, reflection, and unity, allowing students and guests to de-stress while connecting spiritually. True to Sikh tradition, the night also includes Langar, a free communal meal that symbolizes equality and service. In addition, some gatherings feature cultural elements such as turban tying and interactive activities, making the event both spiritually enriching and culturally engaging. Open to people of all backgrounds, Kirtan Night offers a welcoming space to experience Sikh faith, music, and community on campus.",
