In the heart of the Amazon rainforest, the Murui-Muina people of Legu\u00edzamo, Colombia, defend their culture and traditions after surviving the genocide perpetrated by the rubber company Casa Arana. In a sound and visual journey through the rivers and jungles of Amazonia, The Way Back to the Maloca documents the life of the Murui-Muina people in night ceremonies, agricultural plots, malocas, classrooms, traditional dances, and daily conversations. Will the Murui-Muina people succeed in rescuing their ancestral knowledge and passing it down to the new generations? \u00d3scar is an interdisciplinary scholar and filmmaker with a history, sociology, and anthropology background. Currently, he is a Ph.D. candidate in Latin American and Caribbean History at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.",
