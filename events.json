One of Douglass' oldest traditions, the Sacred Path ceremony recognizes student achievement and fosters Douglass's unique community. Join your fellow Douglass classmates, alumnae, friends, and family as each class is honored with a symbol representing the different class years. After you receive your charm, head to the ceremonial fires on the sacred path to make a wish!  Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white, sophomores wear pink, juniors wear red, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm, a token representing her class. All Douglass students, family, faculty, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements* ",
