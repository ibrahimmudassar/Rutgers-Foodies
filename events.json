The grandmother-grandson relationship that is drifting apart is brought close again as Manawei sings and dances in traditional ethnic costume.  Bathed in the spirit of \u201cour culture, our pride\u201d, the film depicts an authentic, rarely seen side of Orchid Island, and engages issues of family relationships, love, abandonment, and grandparenting problems against the backdrop of the Yami(Tao) cultural fault line. All characters except the teacher are portrayed by non-professional actors from the Yami(Tao) ethnic group.",

Join your fellow Douglass classmates, alumnae, friends, and family as each class is honored with a symbol representing the different class years. After you receive your charm, head to the ceremonial fires on the sacred path to make a wish!  Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white, sophomores wear pink, juniors wear red, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm, a token representing her class. All Douglass students, family, faculty, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements* ",
