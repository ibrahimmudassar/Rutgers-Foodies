Similar to any other game jam, participants will be given one week(ish) to design and code a game to show off at the end of the jam. At the kickoff, we will also be unveiling the theme to inspire or challenge our participants, which changes with every Scarlet Game Jam, so each year is a new experience! Food will be provided!! Programmers, musicians, and artists are welcome, but no experience is necessary! The kickoff will be held at CoRE Room 301 from 7pm - 9pm.

            "description": "The ice cream social/ game night is designed as a relaxed, community building event where Honors College students can enjoy sweet treats while engaging in fun and interactive games. The event will feature a variety of ice cream flavors and toppings, paired with board games, card games, and group activities that encourage participation and friendly competition.   This program will fulfill the goal of the Honors College by creating an inclusive and welcoming environment where students can connect outside of academics. It supports wellness by providing a low stress opportunity for students to unwind and it promotes community engagement by bringing together students from different backgrounds. By offering both food and activities, this event creates multiple points for involvement, making it appealing for the students that may come just for the ice cream but stay to meet new people and play games.   I believe that this event will attract a strong audience because it combines popular elements, free food and interactive entertainment, in a way that's approachable and fun. Its casual structure lowers the pressure to participate and makes it especially valuable for first year students who may be adjusting to the HC community and looking for an easy opportunity to make friends.",

Join us on Wednesday, October 1, from 5:30\u20137:00 PM at the Kathleen Ludwig Center for Salsa Dance & Dinner Night. Kick off the evening with a lively salsa dance class, no experience needed, just bring your energy and comfy clothes! After dancing, enjoy a delicious dinner together as we honor the richness of Hispanic culture through music, movement, and community. In partnership with Douglass Women in Science & Engineering (WiSE), the event will also feature The Science of the Scent. Led by Magy Georges, Assistant Dean of WiSE, this interactive activity will explore how fragrance is created, how it connects to memory and identity, and how scents from Latin America such as vanilla, cacao, coffee, and citrus have shaped both culture and science. Participants will even get the chance to craft and take home their own unique scent!",

The talks are usually accompanied with dinner, which the speaker gets to pick from local restaurants including Delhi Garden, Efes, Mamouns and more. The first SSPAR of the academic year will be held on October 2nd, and Lana Eid will be our first presenter. We'll be ordering some delicious Lebanese food from Evelyn's! Hope to see you all there! Talk Title: Lessons from Cluster Lens Models: The Giant Arc in Abell 370. Abstract: We aim to improve cluster lens modeling and source reconstruction by utilizing the full information in giant, caustic-crossing arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. Lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources, but spatially extended giant arcs provide more constraints; however, they require a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the extended source. We use the Abell 370 cluster lens to examine how the constraints from lensed giant arcs compare with those from collections of point-like images. We find that existing Hubble Frontier Fields lens models cannot reproduce the Abell 370 arc in detail and result in unphysical source models. We then show that using the full arc as a constraint improves resolution-limited assumptions, local parameters, and critical curves in lens models. We also discuss a new python package currently being developed and designed for reconstructing lensed giant arcs, which we use to evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression modes for de-lensed data. We finally discuss how this new method can be utilized for both high-resolution studies as well as large surveys.",

Wednesday, October 15, 2025, 5.30 \u2013 7.00 PM Art History Graduate Student Lounge, Vorhees Hall, 71 Hamilton Street, New Brunswick   Print Matters: Media and Modernity in Illustrated Magazines, 1910\u20131970Edited by Maria Antonella Pelizzari and Andr\u00e9s Mario Zervig\u00f3n Available November 2025 In the early to mid-twentieth century, the vast majority of printed photographs appeared in the pages of illustrated magazines. Publications such as Life, China Pictorial, Drum, Picture Post, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications, showing how their layouts were affected by political, commercial, editorial, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andr\u00e9s Mario Zervig\u00f3n is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.",

She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric, yarn, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media. Although she embraces a language of abstraction, bold colors, patterns, and symbols allude to queer and feminist references, sourcing further inspiration from interpersonal and environmental forces such as electricity, volatility, connectivity, and energy exchange.    Don't miss out\u2014RSVP today and join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass to view the exhibition during a reception and for a talk by artist Liz Collins on October 16, from 5:00 to 6:30 PM!

Our showcase is our biggest event, where our members get to showcase a multitude of K-pop performances they\u2019ve been preparing for months for our audience. There are two acts with an intermission, which includes a raffle with a bunch of prizes our audience can partake in and possibly win big! And the best part is that admission is FREE for all!  You don't have to be performing to attend, so come out and support our performers! \u2661 Let's cheer each other on and enjoy each other's company! You may also get some sweet treats from us to enjoy while watching performances \ud83d\udc40 Our showcase is also livestreamed on our YouTube page for audience members who cannot attend in person, but would love to support our performers! If you're watching from online, thank you for supporting Haru Dance \u2661 More information on parking will be detailed here later in the semester. Contact us directly on IG: @harudance_official or Email: haru.kdcc@gmail.com if you have any questions! Can't wait to see y'all soon!",
