We will meet up at the event. Your Scarlet Arts Rx host Peichi will be there around 3:30pm (a tad bit late, because the start of the event usually involves cheese, wine, chewing and chatting) and will be wearing a red Scarlet Arts Rx name tag. Please introduce yourself and she will connect you with other Scarlet Arts Rx students who are in attendance! No registration needed, just show up! You can stay for as long as you like. ",

At the beginning of each Scarlet Game Jam, we will also be unveiling the (optional) theme to inspire or challenge our participants, which changes with every Scarlet Game Jam, so each year is a new experience! Programmers, musicians, and artists are welcome, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around, the game jam is 2 weeks long to give everyone extra time to work on their games! Feel free to take the whole 2 weeks, one week, or even a single day to work on your game. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on April 14th.
