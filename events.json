            "description": "We're happy to announce that our first blood drive of the semester on campus is scheduled on September 13th and 14th at the Yard on College Avenue. We feel great pride that Rutger's UBI is able to help in this beautiful drive hosted by Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health. Today, the country confronts new challenges that disrupt the blood supply. As concerns compound, blood centers nationwide are facing a decline in donor turnout, and donor eligibility misinformation. Yet the need for blood remains constant. We need youth like you to donate and save a life!  Donors will receive a $5 coffee gift card, a jersey mikes sub, a t-shirt, and a chance to win 1 out of 4 $25 WaWa Gift cards!",

            "description": "Celebrate the end of the academic year by joining Douglass staff, the Voorhees Choir, and fellow students for the annual Sacred Path Ceremony. One of Douglass' oldest traditions, the Sacred Path ceremony recognizes student achievement and fosters Douglass's unique community. Join your fellow Douglass classmates, alumnae, friends, and family as each class is honored with a symbol representing the different class years. After you receive your charm, head to the ceremonial fires on the sacred path to make a wish!  Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white, sophomores wear pink, juniors wear red, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm, a token representing her class. All Douglass students, family, faculty, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements* ",
