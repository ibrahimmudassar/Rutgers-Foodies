            "description": "Abstract: Origami is the art of folding pieces of paper into a finished sculpture, all performed without cutting or gluing. It encompasses all levels of skill; from napkin swans at restaurants to intricate designs made with hundreds of folds. Behind it all, however, is a rich and varied field of mathematical study, which in the past years has been of considerable interest in numerous fields. My talk is meant to be a small (and fun!) introduction to the mathematics behind origami. We'll go over some simple constructions, motivate some theorems, and make you reconsider everything you thought you knew about folding paper. I'll of course bring along some origami paper for you to follow along (or mess around with) during the talk. Just make sure not to ruin them while eating some delicious Delhi Garden food!",

In the heart of the Amazon rainforest, the Murui-Muina people of Legu\u00edzamo, Colombia, defend their culture and traditions after surviving the genocide perpetrated by the rubber company Casa Arana. In a sound and visual journey through the rivers and jungles of Amazonia, The Way Back to the Maloca documents the life of the Murui-Muina people in night ceremonies, agricultural plots, malocas, classrooms, traditional dances, and daily conversations. Will the Murui-Muina people succeed in rescuing their ancestral knowledge and passing it down to the new generations? \u00d3scar is an interdisciplinary scholar and filmmaker with a history, sociology, and anthropology background. Currently, he is a Ph.D. candidate in Latin American and Caribbean History at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.",
