The Discovery Advantage initiative is an attempt at holistically reimagining the student experience at Rutgers to ensure students are supported in their well-being and sense of belonging, and prepared to succeed in their academic and co-curricular pursuits as well as in the real world. Discovery Advantage is comprised of six workstreams: curriculum, advising and academic support, living-learning communities, enrollment and marketing, administrative and financial structure, and data core. Members of the six Discovery Advantage workstreams have spent the past year examining aspects of the undergraduate experience at Rutgers, united around a goal of developing a blueprint for implementing the three main priorities of the Academic Master Plan\u2019s Student Success pillar in each workstream focus area. Drs. Scott and Moehling will be presenting the preliminary report to us on Thursday, which shows each workstream\u2019s recommendations to improve the student experience. They are hoping to receive our feedback, take any questions, and respond to our concerns. ",
