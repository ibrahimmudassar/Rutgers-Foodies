A panel of professional geologists will be speaking about their experiences going from college into the workforce. Students majoring in geology or other related sciences might not be aware of the numerous career opportunities available, especially since our university has a primary focus on conducting research. Attendees will be able to ask questions and participate in casual conversations with geologists working in industry to network and have an insight on what their career paths might look like after graduation. If you are interested in running for an e-board position for the club, you MUST attend this meeting!   Our panelists will be coming from: WSP - geology and geological engineering Roux - environmental consulting Museums - curating   Free pizza will be provided by the Rutgers Earth and Planetary Sciences Department and is first come, first serve. Attendance is free and all are welcome.",

All students who are conducting neuroscience-related research are invited to present their research projects to an audience for the chance to win cash prizes. This year, AXON will be held on April 27th from 1230pm - 5pm in room 105 of the Psychology Building on Busch Campus. Students at Rutgers have the option to present their research via presentation of a physical printed poster during a poster session, or via a 15 minute slideshow presentation (10 minute talk + 5 minutes for questions). Students would not only be able to present their research at a conference recognized by the National Honor Society of Neuroscience, they would also have the chance to get their presentations judged for the possibility of winning a cash prize (a $150 prize, a $125 prize, and a $100 prize will be awarded). Attending and presenting at AXON is completely free, and food will be provided and catered (food will be catered from Jersey Mikes and Szechwan Ichiban). Students interested in presenting at AXON 5.0 will need to submit their abstracts using the following form by April 19th at 11:59pm: https://forms.gle/6Ro3aqEK1kGeE5cq5   Since the theme of AXON this year is \"Exercise and the Brain\", Dr. Peter Douris, the keynote speaker, will be talking about whether exercise is the true ultimate modality for optimal cognitive performance (your neuroscience research does not have to be exercise related). Here is the website dedicated to the conference: https://axon2024.myportfolio.com/. Make sure to check it out. If you have any questions, feel free to contact nrp.rutgers@gmail.com.",
